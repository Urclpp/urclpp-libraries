inst library by Kuggo.
This lib was made to be imported by default and be used to define instructions and their respective operand types to be checked.
How to define an Instruction (outside of this library):
An instruction definition takes the following format: INST keyword, followed by the opcode of the instruction we want to define, then we put the types of the operands (if it has operands).
The library supoports matching types with the following list:
WB: Write back to register (register to be written)
LOC: Instruction location (address to branch to)
MEM: Heap location (address to load/store to)
REG: Register to be read
IO: Port number/name to be used
IMM: Any type that can be interpreted as imm value (label, char, memory location, jump address, imm literals)
ANY: Any type at all (except Port number/name)
